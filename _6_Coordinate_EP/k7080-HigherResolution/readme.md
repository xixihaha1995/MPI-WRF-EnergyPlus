### TODO

- geoJSON centroids for all buildings
- WRF global xlat, xlong
- mappings from WRF grids to IDF centroids
- WRF calling = 1 (get all the mappings, save the 3D-WRF-Mapping-EP variable into spawn_children)
- WRF calling = 1 (curXlat, curXlong) > call necessary > get corresponding response 
(for each timestep, IDF callback functions will and must be called exactly once.)
